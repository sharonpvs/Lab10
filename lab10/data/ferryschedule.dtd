<!-- A sailing is a trip between the two end-points of the Southern Gulf Islands
ferry run, namely Long Harbour (Salt Spring) and Tsawwassen (mainland).
Each sailing has an origin and destination port, departure and arrival times
between these, and then a days attribute specifiying which days of the week this
sailing applies to.
A sailing may have any number of stops along the way. -->
